# CSS Battle Solutions

This repo contains all my solutions for various challenges on [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/). They are sorted according to the day or challenge number.

To simulate how they appear on that website, I wrote a simple frame class to create a 400x300 frame. Each solution is contained within a <div class="frame">, and the interior of that div is what I would actually submit on the website.

There are a few things I needed to change to make it display correctly, so anyplace you see ".frame{}" referenced within the style tags, you can replace that with either "*" or "body" depending.

* note: at a certain point I stopped putting them in frames entirely. so most of them won't actually be in a frame, just the raw code I copied directly from the cssbattle site as I wrote it and pasted into this repo. Most files have a comment at the bottom containing the minified solution, which removes any unnecessary characters (e.g. closing html tags, the final css curly brace, most px annotations)
